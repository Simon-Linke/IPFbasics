# IPFbasics
This repository provides basic scripts that apply the Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF) in different programming languages. Thus, it helps to discover the IPF for the first time.

The Julia scripts can be used to investigate the mathematical behavior of the IPF concerning stability and limits, similar to what was done by Linke et al.[[1](#1)].

The Python scripts allow the first approaches in using the IPF as a (non-real-time) Synthesizer.

The PureData patches can be used to introduce real-time synthesis utilizing the IPF.

Further applications (mainly for sonification) are shown in another repository: https://github.com/Simon-Linke/IPF-Sonification-PD

### Funding

This research was funded under the Program "Innovative Hochschule" (innovative university) by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) of Germany and the City of Hamburg (Grant No. 13IHS232C).
